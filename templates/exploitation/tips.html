<p> Once you've identified the CVE, you can attempt to exploit it using an available script. After acquiring the code successfully, read it carefully to understand how to run it properly. For example, many scripts may require certain parameters or other types of setup.<br><br>

    Exploits are written in a variety of languages, so you may need to do some research to understand how to use a new technology. You can search for resources like "How to run [language] scripts" to get started.<br><br>
    
    If the exploit runs successfully and you realize that you have gained the desired access to the system, you can proceed to the <a href= "{{url_for(next_tip_name +  '.interface')}}" style="color: #f44336;"><b>Installation Phase</b></a>.<br><br>
    
    Ensure that you have a secure testing environment separate from your real system to avoid accidental damage.</p>
